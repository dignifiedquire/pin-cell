//! This library defines the `PinCell` type, a pinning variant of the standard
//! library's `RefCell`.
//!
//! It is not safe to "pin project" through a `RefCell` - getting a pinned
//! reference to something inside the `RefCell` when you have a pinned
//! refernece to the `RefCell` - because `RefCell` is too powerful.
//!
//! A `PinCell` is slightly less powerful than `RefCell`: unlike a `RefCell`,
//! one cannot get a mutable reference into a `PinCell`, only a pinned mutable
//! reference (`Pin<&mut T>`). This makes pin projection safe, allowing you
//! to use interior mutability with the knowledge that `T` will never actually
//! be moved out of the `RefCell` that wraps it.
